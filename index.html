      <p class="article_summary">In my bioinformatics work, I often find myself maintaining a text file with commands, options, and paths relevant to the tasks I am working on. I have a workflow to yank a selection from this text file into an intermediate file and then use the fc builtin to copy the selection onto my command prompt. This workflow works well but I wanted to improve it even more increasing efficiency.
After some experimentation I was inspired by the fzf (Fuzzy Finder) project and it&rsquo;s use of readline bindings for looking up your shell history.</p>

      <p class="article_summary">When working between projects, I realize that I almost always repeat the same few tasks including:
 Typing cd &lt;path&gt; to enter the project directory Typing git fetch or git pull to check/merge any changes upstream Typing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-b , while in tmux to rename the window to the project name  By incorporating the wonderful command-line fuzzy finder fzf I wrote a small bash function called cdp to automate these steps.</p>

      <p class="article_summary">I came across a great episode while listening to Software Engineering Radio the other day while on my morning walk.
Episode 391 features Jeremy Howard from fast.ai explaining deep learning from concept to implementation.
I had heard of fast.ai before in an Elixir meetup where I met a gentlemen who designs machine learning systems for monitoring people in hospital beds. The system uses visual detection aided by deep learning to alert staff if a patient has fallen from their bed hopefully getting the patient the help they need more quickly.</p>
